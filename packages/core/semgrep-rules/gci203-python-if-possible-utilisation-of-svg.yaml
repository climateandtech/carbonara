      If possible, the utilisation of svg image format (or `<svg/>` html tag) is recommended over other image format. Because SVGs are generally smaller than other image format, they’re less taxing on your server despite needing to render on load. When to use SVG: - Your image is used for decorative website graphics, logos, icons, graphs and diagrams, and other simple images. - You image require animation. - You image need to be responsive and scale without lack of quality. Some advantages of using SVG: - SVGs are scalable and will render pixel-perfect at any resolution whereas JPEGs, PNGs and GIFs will not. - SVGs are vector images and therefore are usually much smaller in file-size than bitmap-based images. - SVGs can be embedded into the HTML which means they can be cached, edited directly using CSS and indexed for greater accessibility. - SVGs can be animated directly or by using CSS or JavaScript making it easy for web designers to add interactivity to a site.
