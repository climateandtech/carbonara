    message: >-
      When iterating over any collection, fetch the size of the collection in advance to avoid fetching it on each iteration.
      This saves CPU cycles and therefore consumes less power.
      Consider storing the size in a variable before the loop: int size = collection.size();
    pattern: |
      for ($TYPE $I = $INIT; $I < $COLLECTION.size(); $UPDATE) {
        ...
      }
