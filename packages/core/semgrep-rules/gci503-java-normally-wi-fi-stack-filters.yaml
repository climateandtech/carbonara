    message: >-
      Normally the Wi-Fi stack filters out packets not explicitly addressed to the device. Acquiring a Multicast Lock with `WifiManager.MulticastLock.acquire()` will cause the stack to receive packets addressed to multicast addresses. Processing these extra packets can cause a noticeable battery drain and must be disabled when not needed with to a call to `WifiManager.MulticastLock.release()`.
    pattern: |
      $OBJ.createMulticastLock(...)
