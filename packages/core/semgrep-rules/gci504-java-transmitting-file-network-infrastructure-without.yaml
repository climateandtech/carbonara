      Transmitting a file over a network infrastructure without compressing it consumes more energy than with compression. More precisely, energy efficiency is improved in case the data is compressed at least by 10%, transmitted and decompressed at the other network node. From the Android client side, it means making a post HTTP request using a `GZIPOutputStream` instead of the classical OutputStream, along with the `HttpURLConnection` object.
