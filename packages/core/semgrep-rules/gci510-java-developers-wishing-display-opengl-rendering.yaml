      For developers wishing to display OpenGL rendering, when choosing the rendering mode with `GLSurfaceView#setRenderMode(int renderMode)`, using `RENDERMODE_WHEN_DIRTY` instead of `RENDERMODE_CONTINUOUSLY` (by default) can improve battery life and overall system performance by allowing the GPU and CPU to idle when the view does not need to be updated.
    pattern: |
      $VIEW.setRenderMode(GLSurfaceView.RENDERMODE_CONTINUOUSLY)
