      Creation of a Media Recorder object with `new MediaRecorder()` is used to record audio and video. Class own a `release()` method. In addition to unnecessary resources (such as memory and instances of codecs) being held, failure to call this method immediately if a media object is no longer needed may also lead to continuous battery consumption for mobile devices.

      new MediaRecorder()
