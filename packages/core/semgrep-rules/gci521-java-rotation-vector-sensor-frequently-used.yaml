      The rotation vector sensor is the most frequently used sensor for motion detection and monitoring. When using `SensorManager#getDefaultSensor(int type)`, always prefer the constant `TYPE_GEOMAGNETIC_ROTATION_VECTOR` which is similar to `TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR`, but using a magnetometer instead of using a gyroscope. This sensor uses lower power than the other rotation vectors, because it doesn't use the gyroscope. However, it is more noisy and will work best outdoors.
