    message: >-
      To avoid draining the battery, an iOS device adapt its brightness to the environment . Hence, keeping forcing the screen brightness on should be avoided, unless it is absolutely necessary. If so, developers typically force the Brightness to 1 with `UIScreen.main.brightness = a float`.
