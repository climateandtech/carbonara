      Location awareness is one of the most popular features used by apps. An important point is to try to get the best possible provider (`LocationManager#getBestProvider()`) based on an energy criteria thanks to `Criteria#setPowerRequirement(int level)`, using constant `POWER_LOW` instead of `POWER_HIGH` or `POWER_MEDIUM`.
    pattern: |
      $MANAGER.requestLocationUpdates($PROVIDER, $MIN_TIME, $MIN_DISTANCE, $LISTENER)
