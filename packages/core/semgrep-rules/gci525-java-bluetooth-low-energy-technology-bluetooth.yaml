      With Bluetooth Low Energy technology, a Bluetooth Smart Ready device (the master) will establish a link with a Bluetooth Smart device (the slave). Most often, the slave is a GATT server and the master is a GATT client. GATT capable devices can be discovered using BLE scan process. The default and preferred advertising mode is `ADVERTISE_MODE_LOW_POWER` when calling `AdvertiseSettings.Builder#setAdvertiseMode(int advertiseMode).`
