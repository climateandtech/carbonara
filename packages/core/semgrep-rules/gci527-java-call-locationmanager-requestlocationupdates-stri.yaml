    message: >-
      With a call to `LocationManager#requestLocationUpdates(String provider, long minTime, float minDistance, LocationListener listener)`, the location provider will only send your application an update when the location has changed by at least minDistance meters AND at least minTime milliseconds have passed. So `minTime` should be the primary tool to conserve battery life, and, to a lesser extent, `minDistance`. These two must imperatively be greater than 0.

      $MANAGER.requestLocationUpdates($PROVIDER, $MIN_TIME, $MIN_DISTANCE, $LISTENER)
